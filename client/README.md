<h1>MVP Notes and Todo</h1>

<h2>Todo</h2>

<p>Consider how to set up the update route - where is it best to have the form? For example, selecting a button in the gallery opens a form? Or stick with a simple complete toggle button next to the favourite?</p>

<p>How to use modals? Can modals be set up as a form?</p>

<ul>
<li>Split components into new component folder</li>
<li>Connect to database on frontend - proxy error</li>
<li>Render all projects in the gallery</li>
<li>Link form submission to POST to create new projects</li>

</ul>
